Context:  

SpaN is a company that provides an online portal for real estate services. The main
functionality of the portal is that property listings are published and visitors can search for
properties based on a set of search criteria. The engineering team of SpaN has implemented
a logging mechanism so that the search criteria of every property search that is performed
by an enduser, is logged anonymized in json format.  

<b>The goal is to build a data pipeline that ingests the SpaN property searches data (raw data),
performs any needed cleaning and transformations and enriches them with geographical
information.</b>

Specifications:
- The Data Scientists are going to be querying the data that you will provide them with
Amazon Athena. Amazon Athena charges are calculated on the amount of data that
are scanned by each query (pay per read model), so there is a strong requirement to
structure the data provided to the Data Scientists in the most cost-efficient way
minimizing scanned data for the queries.
- Analysis of the data is going to be performed on a per country basis. For instance,
the analysts will aggregate performed searches per property category (residential,
commercial, land) and per listing type (sale, rent) for each country separately, that
the property search was made.
- Analysis of the data for each country will also be focusing on the most popular
(searched) regions in each country as well as the most popular search criteria.
- Apart from the predefined queries, the Data Scientists will be performing ad hoc
exploratory queries in the data.
- The columns that need to be kept in the cleaned dataset are the following:Date, Area Id, Category, Listing Type, Living Area Low, Living Area High, Price Low, Price High, New development, Garage, Storage
, Balcony, Secure Door, Alarm, Fireplace, Elevator, Garden, Rooms Low, Rooms High, Pets Allowed.
- In the portals, a property search can be performed in multiple areas at once.
- A property search can also be performed by a real estate broker in their backoffice
application. In this case, the logged property search contains a broker id or a set of
broker ids (in cases of networks of brokers). The analysis that needs to be supported
concerns solely property searches performed by the endusers, so the property
searches performed by real estate brokers need to be filtered out of the cleaned
dataset.
- When a property search contains NULL values for price and living area ranges (price
low, price high, living area low, living area high) the portal translates the NULL values
into a predefined set of default values per listing type. The default values are as
follows:
o Rent Price Low: 9
o Sale Price Low: 998
o Rent Price High: 999999
o Sale Price High: 99999999
o Living Area Low: 3
o Living Area High: 99999999
